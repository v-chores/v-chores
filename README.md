## Overview
### Description
VChores is an app for Vassar Student to post and exchange "personal services" such as haircuts, nails, sowing, etc., or even make a quick buck in return for the service. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Job Listing
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Users can request "personal services" and connect with a "Professional" - those who can provide those services. The user can then decide to message this person and sign up for an appointment. 
- **Market:** Any Vassar Student could choose to use this app - preferrably those who either can provide or need different services. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on their urgency for the services or if they want to make a quick buck. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with just Vassar students who need different favors/services. However, this can be scaled into different universities, communities, and towns.
